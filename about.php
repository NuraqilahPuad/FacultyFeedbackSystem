               <P>A faculty feedback system is a set of procedures used in institutions to address complaints and resolve disputes. There is also a major need to collect, review and understand the nature of conflict management and complaint systems around the faculty. So, our complaint system is more user friendly because we want to ease the user and the management staff. This complaint system can search any complaint report in the system by the report ID. So, it will not be difficult to find any complaint later. Furthermore, this system also provides a deleting option on the report that has been solved. So, this will make the system clear from the old report that has been solved and only the active cases will open for the admin to resolve.
